# mypublicip

Goal: let you know whenever your public IP is renewed/changed.

Description: Tool to notify when your public IP is changed; **It is for personal usage only** please don't expect I am providing support for these codes; I have these scripts running in some of my servers and they notify me whenever my public IP is renewed.

Versions: There is a simplified version that actually was the first version and that inspired me to build the second and more complete version
that runs on CLI and installed by RPM ( for now only teste don Fedora 24 ).

simplified: https://github.com/eduardocerqueira/mypublicip/script/myip.py

complete: https://github.com/eduardocerqueira/mypublicip

Info below are describing the script for complete version:

Useful when you use a server not in a datacenter or running behind a regular ISP router without domain or static IP.

**possible use cases:**

* running in a cron job
* running as command line whenever you want to know what is your public ip
* others
